Usage
-----
First you need to start **rocketchat-jira-webhook**

Second you need to going to Rocket.Chat administration panel and setting up outgoing webhook pointing 
at **rocketchat-jira-webhook** instance.  

There is three route you can point your Rocket.Chat instance  
/jira - only jira issues would be summarized at this route  
/confluence - only confluence issues would be summarized at this  
/jiraconfluence - and both would be summarized at this

After configuration complete you can write a message containing some JIRA issues or Confluence documents. For example: `TEST-1234` 
or something like `https://confluence.mycompnay.com/dispaly/TST/test+page`
Then **rocketchat-jira-webhook** will try to gather details about issues or document and reply it to Rocket.Chat if found some.

Connections can be checked with /health route.  

```bash
curl http://localhost:4567/health
